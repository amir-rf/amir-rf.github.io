I’m Amir Hossein Fahim Raouf, a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at North Carolina State University. My research spans wireless communications, spectrum sharing, non-terrestrial networks, and hybrid VLC-RF systems. I work at the intersection of physical-layer design and intelligent systems, combining traditional communication theory with AI-driven models for tomorrow’s wireless infrastructure.

Where others may treat education as a destination, I’ve always embraced it as a journey. I believe that meaningful progress lies in the process—not just the outcome. Each research question, each simulation, and each failed experiment is a step forward, not a detour. As a researcher, I strive to move beyond conventional boundaries and explore the frontiers of wireless systems with both curiosity and precision.

In recent years, I’ve contributed to collaborative projects at CableLabs and PAWR/AERPAW, where I designed and tested systems for spectrum efficiency and altitude-dependent spectrum modeling. My work has also focused on optimizing hybrid RF/VLC networks, analyzing outage probabilities, and improving energy harvesting models in realistic environments.

I’m passionate about translating deep theoretical insights into practical wireless systems that can scale, adapt, and coexist harmoniously. From RF propagation modeling to quantum-inspired underwater communications, my work reflects a commitment to both innovation and rigor.

Feel free to explore my publications, projects, and research interests. Let’s connect if you’re curious about collaborative research, internships, or technical discussions around 6G, ISAC, or beyond.

I’m Amir RF, a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at North Carolina State University. My research explores the crossroads of wireless communications, spectrum sharing, non-terrestrial networks, and hybrid VLC-RF systems. I combine classical communication theory with AI-driven models to help design the wireless systems of tomorrow.  

I see education as a journey rather than a destination. Every research question, simulation, and even failed experiment is a step toward meaningful progress. Along the way, I have worked with CableLabs and PAWR/AERPAW on projects that improve spectrum efficiency and altitude-dependent spectrum modeling. My work has also focused on optimizing hybrid RF/VLC networks, analyzing outage probabilities, and building realistic energy-harvesting models.  

Before coming to the United States, I pursued my master’s degree in Istanbul, Turkey, where I specialized in quantum key distribution. In 2021, during the pandemic, I took on freelance projects while waiting for my visa, which reminded me that research is not confined to labs or campuses.  

Outside academia, I like to keep life balanced. I have lived in five cities across three countries, and I always bring my love for **pizza** with me. I cook it from scratch and experiment with different dough styles. I am also a music enthusiast, an avid reader, a frequent traveler, and a movie fan. I know *Friends* so well I can recite lines by heart. As a side project, I even recorded an **audiobook in Persian** for *The Catcher in the Rye*.  

Looking ahead, I plan to continue pushing the boundaries of wireless research while also pursuing personal goals: visiting all 50 U.S. states, running the New York City Marathon, and driving the iconic Route 66 from Chicago to Santa Monica. For me, research and life share the same spirit of exploration, endurance, and discovery.
